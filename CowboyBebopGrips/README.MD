### Printing suggestion:
- I can only recommend Nylon-like SLA resin or some sort of MJF printing for these grips. You can try FDM printing, but I wasn't happy with the resolution of the finished print. It's possible to print a mold and cast them out of epoxy or urethane for increased strength and impact resistance.
- Follow the printOrientationFile.lys for print orientation. I print with Lychee so I've included a printOrientationFile.STL if you use something else so you can understand how to orient your prints. 
- You will need to have the ...laserPlate.stl file CNC printed. There is no way a 3D printed part could stand the recoil shock.
- You will need to DIY your own positive and negative leads for the battery terminals.

### Post Processing:
- You'll have to sand to fit. There's some room for movement so that you can fit it to your Jericho. You may need to apply some gaffers tape on the underside of the Front or Backstraps to get a firm fit as well.

### Assembling/Installation:
- Check out the ...assembly.STEP files to understand how to assemble your grips and where the screws go to secure the grip.
- To install the frontstrap, you'll have to work the dovetails over the frame to fit.
	> Insert the laserPlate into the backstrap of your choice
	> Secure the laserPlate with the two (2) M2 x 4mm Countersunk Machine Screws
	> Install the Prusa Nuts on the inside of the backstrap
	> Install the backstrap/laserPlate assembly so that the frontstrap dovetails engage with the laserPlate.
	> Secure the grip with the two (2) M3 x 6mm Countersunk Machine Screws
	> Install and secure the positive and negative leads to the Laser mainBody
	> Install and solder the microswitch to the positive and negative leads
	> Install the laser module and solder the negative and positive terminals to the battery terminal leads
	> Install the laser plug
	> Install the two (2) M3 x 3mm Set Screw
	> Install the Laser mainBody
	> Secure the Laser mainBody with the two (2) M2 x 8mm Hex Socket Machine Screws
	> Install the CR2025 battery
	> Install the TPU activation button to the battery cover
	> Install the battery cover
	> Secure with the M3 x 6mm Countersunk Machine Screw

### Warning:
These are still 3d printed grips. If you choose to print them and live fire with them, please do so at your own risk.
