A stand for the Jericho 941 (pre-2007) and any CZ-75 based frame.

### Features:
- Full length of magazine for better alignment
- Logo emblems for CZ, Tanfoglio, IMI, and Cowboy Bebop to identify the manufacturer

### What you'll need:
- 4mm Adhesive backed Rubber Mat

### Printing suggestion:
- Recommended to print stand in ABS, ABS+, or PETG.
- Follow the printOrientationFile.3mf for print orientation. If importing to CURA you can simply import the models and then slice with your settings. In PrusaSlicer it does not carry the information over well from CURA.
- Recommended to print the emblems/coins standing up. Resin selection does not matter. Please view the attached printOrientationfile.lys or .stl for proper orientation.

### Post Processing:
- Nothing much for post processing on the stand. Apply the 4mm adhesive backed rubber mat on the base of the stand and trim excess.
- For the emblems standard resin post processing applies. Paint as necessary.
