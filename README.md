### Background Story:
I picked up a surplus Jericho 941 a while ago with the intention of building out a set of functional Cowboy Bebop laser sight grips. I've finished them, but I'm looking to see if I can partner with someone to actually produce them. The plan is to produce them or upload them here if I can't find anyone in a reasonable amount of time. That said, I wanted to display my Jericho and have a set of back up stock grips. That's what's here in thie archive. Just some grips and a stand. Coming soon will be a simple speedloader/unloader and possibly the reverse engineered frame and raw scan data from my Jericho.
