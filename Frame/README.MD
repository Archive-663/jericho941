A reversed engineered Jericho 941 (pre-2007) frame

### Features:
- Partially complete reverse engineered frame for you to build accessories for the Jericho 941

### Background Story:
This Jericho frame has been reversed engineered from a 3d scan from my personal Jericho. There may be some dimensions that are off because of age, wear, and design inference, but it is as accurate as I can have it.
